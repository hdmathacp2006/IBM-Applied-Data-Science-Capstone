🚀 Applied Data Science Capstone

This capstone represents the 10th and final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. It brings together all the concepts, tools, and techniques learned throughout the specialization into a comprehensive real-world data science project.

📄 Project Background

SpaceX has emerged as a leader in the modern commercial space industry by significantly reducing the cost of space travel. Falcon 9 launches are advertised at approximately $62 million, while competitors typically exceed $165 million per launch. A major factor behind these savings is SpaceX’s ability to reuse the rocket’s first stage.

By analyzing publicly available data and applying machine learning techniques, this project aims to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 launch will successfully land and be reused — a key indicator of launch cost efficiency.

📄 Questions to be answered

How do factors such as payload weight, launch location, flight frequency, and orbital parameters influence first-stage landing success?

Has the success rate of landings improved over time?

Which machine learning algorithm performs best for this binary classification problem?
